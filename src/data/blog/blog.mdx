# A Brief History of Web Apps – Why Qwik is Innovative
Web apps have evolved significantly since their inception in the 1990s. They started as simple static pages with hyperlinks and evolved into dynamic pages with server-side scripting. With the advent of AJAX in the early 2000s, web apps became more interactive and responsive. However, they still suffered from slow page load times and poor performance.

Qwik is an innovative framework that addresses these issues by offering instant-loading web apps without effort. It was created by Misko Hevery, the creator of Angular, Adam Bradley, who created Ionic, and Manu Almeida, who created Gin Framework. Qwik is designed to be edge-optimized, auto lazy-loading, and fun. It allows fully interactive sites to load with almost no JavaScript and pickup from where the server left off.

# Getting Started with Qwik
To get started with Qwik, you can follow these steps:

Install Qwik CLI: You can install Qwik CLI by running npm install -g qwik-cli.
Create a new project: You can create a new project by running qwik create my-app.
Start the development server: You can start the development server by running qwik serve.
Build your app: You can build your app for production by running qwik build.
Introducing Qwik - the HTML first framework
Qwik is an open-source DOM-centric, resumable web-app framework designed for best possible time-to-interactive, by focusing on resumability of server-side-rendering of HTML and fine-grained lazy-loading of code. It offers instant-loading web apps without effort.

# Qwik – The Post-Modern Framework
Qwik is a frontend framework for creating web applications that offers lightning-fast page load times, regardless of the size and complexity of your site. It allows fully interactive sites to load with almost no JavaScript and pickup from where the server left off.

Qwik is also edge-optimized and auto lazy-loading. This means that it loads only what’s needed when it’s needed, making it faster than other frameworks that load everything upfront. It also allows you to write components in pure HTML and CSS without any JavaScript.
